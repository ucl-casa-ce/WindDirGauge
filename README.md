 In addition to reading the MQTT data and using the Servo Easing Library for the servo, the code also includes a time function, allowing the gauge to turn the LED lights/Servo on and off at set times. This is used to turn off at night.

 The code can be used to create any gauge with a 360 degree range, see comments in file to set up details.
